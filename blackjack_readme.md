Assignment 5 - Simple Black Jack Game"

This is a simple interactive game for one (1) user to play against
the computer (the Dealer). This game uses infinite decks (i.e. there is
always the same probability of drawing any card so card counting will not
work) and uses the range of card A through K (the basic assignment was to use
1 - 10, the full range was for bonus marks).

This game uses the following basic rules:
- player can stand or hit at any time their hand is active.
- dealer must hit on less than 17.
- tie goes to the dealer.
- no ability to double down or split hands.
- no "betting" on hands, simply a win-or-lose game.
